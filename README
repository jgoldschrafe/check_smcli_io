INTRODUCTION
------------
This plugin is designed to report performance data on LSI SANs (e.g. IBM
DS4000/5000/6000 series) back to Nagios, where it can be charted by
pnp4nagios. It is designed to be used with any version of pnp4nagios
with support for storing datastores in individual RRDs.

INSTALLATION
------------
These steps assume you are already running pnp4nagios >= 0.6.0 and have it
configured with Nagios.

- Install LSI's SMcli management utility. This script works by parsing the
  output of this tool. It can go wherever you like -- you'll be passing
  the absolute path of it to the Nagios plugin as a command-line argument.
- Add the managed SAN to SMcli's registry so you can reference it later:

    /opt/IBM_DS/client/SMcli -A <Primary_IP> <Secondary_IP>

- Move the supplied files into their correct locations:
  * check_smcli_io -> Nagios plugin dir (e.g. /usr/lib/nagios/plugins)
  * check_smcli_io.cfg -> pnp4nagios check_commands dir (e.g.
      /etc/pnp4nagios/check_commands)
  * check_smcli_io.php -> pnp4nagios templates dir (e.g.
      /usr/share/pnp4nagios/templates)

  You may need to play with some paths in the check_smcli_io script in order
  to fit your environment. I've tested it on 64-bit CentOS 5. It may or may
  not work for you.
- Add a service check that invokes check_smcli_io with the correct arguments.
